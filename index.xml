      <description>&lt;p&gt;A circle is a simple closed shape. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Drawing is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium. Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse.</description>

A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is &amp;ldquo;an authorization to use licensed material.&amp;rdquo;
In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but that need not be straight. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that it may be curved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted △ ABC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:
 The rake face; and The flank.  The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &amp;ldquo;α&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &amp;ldquo;cutting speed&amp;rdquo; and a secondary motion called &amp;ldquo;feed&amp;rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</description>

      <description>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
 Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</description>

      <description>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</description>

      <description>I am a paragraph in markdown with line wrapping so fit in this width. I am a continuation of the first paragraph as there is no empty line before me.
I am in the second paragraph.
 I am the third one. Even though there are two line breaks before me, this does not create any newline characters. After me there are two spaces before the newline character.
I have a line break before me.</description>
