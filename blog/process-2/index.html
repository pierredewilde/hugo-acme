Milling machines are the principal machine tool used in milling.</li><li>Drilling operations are operations in which holes are produced or refined by bringing a rotating cutter with cutting edges at the lower extremity into contact with the workpiece. Drilling operations are done primarily in drill presses but sometimes on lathes or mills.</li><li>Miscellaneous operations are operations that strictly speaking may not be machining operations in that they may not be swarf producing operations but these operations are performed at a typical machine tool. Burnishing is an example of a miscellaneous operation. Burnishing produces no swarf but can be performed at a lathe, mill, or drill press.</li></ul><p>An unfinished workpiece requiring machining will need to have some material cut away to create a finished product. A finished product would be a workpiece that meets the specifications set out for that workpiece by engineering drawings or blueprints. For example, a workpiece may be required to have a specific outside diameter. A lathe is a machine tool that can be used to create that diameter by rotating a metal workpiece, so that a cutting tool can cut metal away, creating a smooth, round surface matching the required diameter and surface finish. A drill can be used to remove metal in the shape of a cylindrical hole. Other tools that may be used for various types of metal removal are milling machines, saws, and grinding machines. Many of these same techniques are used in woodworking.</p><p>More recent, advanced machining techniques include precision CNC machining, electrical discharge machining (EDM), electro-chemical erosion, laser cutting, or water jet cutting to shape metal workpieces.[6]</p><p>As a commercial venture, machining is generally performed in a machine shop, which consists of one or more workrooms containing major machine tools. Although a machine shop can be a stand-alone operation, many businesses maintain internal machine shops which support specialized needs of the business.</p><p>Machining requires attention to many details for a workpiece to meet the specifications set out in the engineering drawings or blueprints. Beside the obvious problems related to correct dimensions, there is the problem of achieving the correct finish or surface smoothness on the workpiece. The inferior finish found on the machined surface of a workpiece may be caused by incorrect clamping, a dull tool, or inappropriate presentation of a tool. Frequently, this poor surface finish, known as chatter, is evident by an undulating or irregular finish, and the appearance of waves on the machined surfaces of the workpiece.</p><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining>Wikipedia</a></p></div></main><aside><section><h2>Reading time</h2><p>3 minutes (~500 words)</p></section><section><h2>Tags</h2><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/manufacturing>Manufacturing</a></p></section></aside></div><div id=related><h2>Related Pages</h2><ul class=posts><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-4/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-4/cover_hua585c80e51a2636d92a8932dbbada4a7_922778_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part IV</h2><article>A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:
The rake face; and The flank. The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &ldquo;α&rdquo;.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-3/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-3/cover_huc23c9becef1e864c7be62c78d926bacd_530489_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part III</h2><article>Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &ldquo;work&rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-1/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-1/cover_hueae9bd337787402574329f62eac761c7_306420_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part I</h2><article>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</article><div>Read More</div></a></li></ul></div><div class=comments><h2>Contact us</h2><form action=https://api.staticforms.xyz/submit method=post><div><label for=name>Name:</label>
