The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:</p><ul><li>The rake face; and</li><li>The flank.</li></ul><p>The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &ldquo;α&rdquo;. It is measured relative to the plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive or negative. The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly formed work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the finish. This angle between the work surface and the flank surface is called the relief angle. There are two basic types of cutting tools:</p><ul><li>Single point tool; and</li><li>Multiple-cutting-edge tool</li></ul><p>A single point tool has one cutting edge and is used for turning, boring and planing. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the original work surface of the workpart. The point is sometimes rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius.</p><p>Multiple-cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the workpart by rotating. Drilling and milling uses rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Although the shapes of these tools are different from a single-point tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar.</p><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining>Wikipedia</a>.</p></div><div class=comments><h2>Send a comment</h2><form action=https://api.staticforms.xyz/submit method=post><div><label for=name>Name:</label>

To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-2/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-2/cover_hub7f872f3df7955d8566f7133f86cb4d7_70138_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part II</h2><article>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-1/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-1/cover_hueae9bd337787402574329f62eac761c7_306420_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part I</h2><article>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</article><div>Read More</div></a></li></ul></div></main><aside><section><h2>Reading time</h2><p>2 minutes (~300 words)</p></section><section><h2>Tags</h2><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/manufacturing>Manufacturing</a></p></section></aside></div><footer class=dark><nav><ul><li><a href=/hugo-acme/blog>Blog</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/categories>Categories</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/terms>Terms Of Use</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/privacy>Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/credits>Credits</a></li></ul></nav><p id=copyright>Copyright © Acme Corporation™, 1990-2021.
