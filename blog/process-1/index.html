A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Much of modern-day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.</p><p>The precise meaning of the term machining has evolved over the past one and a half centuries as technology has advanced. In the 18th century, the word machinist simply meant a person who built or repaired machines. This person&rsquo;s work was done mostly by hand, using processes such as the carving of wood and the hand-forging and hand-filing of metal. At the time, millwrights and builders of new kinds of engines (meaning, more or less, machines of any kind), such as James Watt or John Wilkinson, would fit the definition. The noun machine tool and the verb to machine (machined, machining) did not yet exist.</p><p>Around the middle of the 19th century, the latter words were coined as the concepts that they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping.[3] In these &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.[4]</p><p>Since the advent of new technologies in the post–World War II era, such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym &ldquo;conventional machining&rdquo; can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage, the term &ldquo;machining&rdquo; without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.</p><p>In the decades of the 2000s and 2010s, as additive manufacturing (AM) evolved beyond its earlier laboratory and rapid prototyping contexts and began to become common throughout all phases of manufacturing, the term subtractive manufacturing became common retronymously in logical contrast with AM, covering essentially any removal processes also previously covered by the term machining. The two terms are effectively synonymous, although the long-established usage of the term machining continues. This is comparable to the idea that the verb sense of contact evolved because of the proliferation of ways to contact someone (telephone, email, IM, SMS, and so on) but did not entirely replace the earlier terms such as call, talk to, or write to.</p><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining>Wikipedia</a>.</p></div><div class=comments><h2>Send a comment</h2><form action=https://api.staticforms.xyz/submit method=post><div><label for=name>Name:</label>

The cutting edge serves to separate chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:
The rake face; and The flank. The rake face which directs the flow of newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle is called the rake angle &ldquo;α&rdquo;.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-3/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-3/cover_huc23c9becef1e864c7be62c78d926bacd_530489_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part III</h2><article>Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &ldquo;work&rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li><li class=post><a href=/hugo-acme/blog/process-2/><img src=/hugo-acme/blog/process-2/cover_hub7f872f3df7955d8566f7133f86cb4d7_70138_500x0_resize_q75_h2_box.webp alt=cover.jpg title=cover.jpg loading=lazy><h2>Our Manufacturing Process Part II</h2><article>The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</article><div>Read More</div></a></li></ul></div></main><aside><section><h2>Reading time</h2><p>3 minutes (~600 words)</p></section><section><h2>Tags</h2><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/line>Line</a></p><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/circle>Circle</a></p><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/triangle>Triangle</a></p><p><a href=/hugo-acme/tags/manufacturing>Manufacturing</a></p></section></aside></div><footer class=dark><nav><ul><li><a href=/hugo-acme/blog>Blog</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/categories>Categories</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/terms>Terms Of Use</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/privacy>Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href=/hugo-acme/credits>Credits</a></li></ul></nav><p id=copyright>Copyright © Acme Corporation™, 1990-2021.
